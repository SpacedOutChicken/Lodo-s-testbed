ideas for tech:

Lasers (what follow-up for Lasers?)
Quantum Supremacy (follow-up of Quantum Computing)
Decision Theory (better as a policy?)
Dynamic Programming
Cybernetics
Systems Theory (better as a policy?)
Fusion Power
Cellular Automata
Memcomputing
Breakthrough Propulsion
Stable Wormholes
Precision Machining
Exotic Matter
Metamaterials
Magnonics
Magnetic Monopoles
Blockchain Accounting (use this: https://thenounproject.com/icon/blockchain-6894815/)
Zero-Point Energy
Antimatter
Mantle Mining
Core Mining
Tectology
Singularity
Artificial Gravity
Ionometallurgy
Predictive Analytics
Fracking

building ideas:

Pilot Plant (where to put?)
Space Elevator
Matter Transmitter
Movement Grid (consider other name - limits enemy movement and boosts friendly movement)
Tectonic Harness (profit from earthquakes)
Repair project (needs name - doubles healing effects, heals units near cities)
Tube Alloys Program (making nuclear weapons)

Scrap Combustion Plant (for when you have more Parts than Power - see if necessary for game balance)

promotion ideas:


unit ideas:

Breacher (can only attack cities, boosts unit strength vs nearest city)
Striker Heli (can transform from fast mode to attack mode)
